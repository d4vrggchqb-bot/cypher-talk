    <h2> MISSION: MULTI-USER PRIVACY VIA CIPHER</h2>
    <div class="mission-content">
      <div class="mission-text">
        <p>
          <strong>CypherTalks </strong> is designed to facilitate secure, multiple-user communication. We serve as the
          platform where users **encrypt their messages using a chosen cipher before sending** and **decrypt messages
          upon reception**. The database stores only the encrypted cyphertext.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CypherTalks is Good to Use: </strong> This website is excellent for users who want complete control
          over their security. By relying on client-side encryption (ciphering), we ensure that even if our database
          were compromised, the data remains unreadable. **We use Supabase for robust authentication and real-time
          database capabilities.**

        <h3>Our Core Purpose</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Control:</strong>Empower users to manage their own encryption keys/methods.</li>
          <li><strong>Platform:</strong>Utilizes **Supabase** for secure user management and real-time chat data
            handling.</li>
          <li><strong>Data:</strong> The platform *only* stores cyphertext, ensuring server-side privacy.</li>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <span class="feature-icon">⛓️</span>
      <h3>Client-Side Ciphering</h3>
      <p>Users encrypt their plaintext messages using a selected cipher (e.g., Caesar, Vigenère) *before* sending. Only
        the encrypted text is transmitted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-card">
      <span class="feature-icon">🗝️</span>
      <h3>Manual Decryption</h3>
      <p>Messages received by users must be manually decrypted using the corresponding key and cipher method, giving you
        full security oversight.</p>

      <h3>Supabase Integration</h3>
      <p>Leveraging **Supabase** for secure user authentication, robust database storage, and fast, multi-user,
        real-time communication channels.</p>
